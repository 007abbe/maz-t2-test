/**
 * Pure stats for the journal header tiles. No Supabase, no DOM.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from `src/domain/trade-stats.js`, which computes DOM's
 * Layer 1. They look similar — both count wins and losses and average R — but
 * they answer to different consumers and disagree everywhere it matters:
 *
 *   - this one summarises *closed* trades; Layer 1 aggregates whatever it was
 *     given, and reports `be` as a category rather than dropping it
 *   - this one rounds for display (integer win rate, raw floats); Layer 1
 *     rounds for a prompt (1dp, 2dp) and returns null where there is no
 *     measurement, because 0 would read to the model as a measured zero
 *   - this one has netPnl, profitFactor, avgWin and avgLoss, which DOM does not
 *     use; Layer 1 has rSample, insufficient and earlySignal, which the header
 *     has no use for
 *
 * Merging them would mean a shared function parameterised on rounding, null
 * policy and filtering — more machinery than the dozen lines it would save.
 * The real cost is elsewhere: Layer 1's output is stored in `dom_reports.stats`
 * and read by the model, so coupling it to these tiles would let a cosmetic
 * header tweak change what a past report can be audited against.
 *
 * Only `pnl` and `risk` are read here; both are used by the legacy dashboard
 * query, so they are known to exist on the production table.

 * A veto has no fill: its P&L is 0 and its risk is 0, so leaving it in would
 * add a row to `count`, a zero to the win-rate denominator, and nothing to
 * `netPnl` — a journal that logs its near-misses honestly would show a falling
 * win rate as a reward. `vetoes` is returned so the UI can still say how many

 * A signed figure with the trader's own symbol in front of it.

 * The sign leads and the symbol follows it — `-$120`, `-kr 120` — because in a
 * journal the first thing to read is whether the number cost you money. Grouping
 * stays en-US (`1,463`) rather than following the symbol: the alternative is
 * guessing a locale from a currency sign, and a trader who set "kr" has said
 * nothing about whether they want a comma or a space.

 * The symbol is module state in lib/display.js, applied once at boot — see the
 * note there on why it is not a parameter.
