 * column is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm` wall-clock text written by a `datetime-local`
 * input, i.e. already in your zone. Comparing it in ET would bucket an
 * evening-logged trade into the wrong day.
 *
 * Because the stored value is local wall clock, string comparison on the date
 * part is exact — no parsing, no offsets.
