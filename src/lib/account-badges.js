 * Account colouring, shared by the journal table, the Accounts UI and the trade
 * form so the four types cannot drift apart on colour.
 *
 * The type *is* the colour: Live purple, Funded green, Evaluation blue, Demo
 * grey. Both the type label and the account's own name take it, so an account
 * is identifiable at a glance without reading the word "Evaluation" — which is
 * the point, since the name is what the table shows.
 *
 * Presentation only, same as trade-badges.js: nothing here decides what a type
 * *is*, it maps a value the row already carries to a class name. The classes
 * resolve to tokens in style.css.
